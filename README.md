# Springs and Articulated Arms

Workbench to allow experiments in articulated arms with springs and forces to simulate a bird wing during wing beats.

You can adjust muscle "pump forces", spring forces, arm lengths and masses at the joints using sliders.

Here's an image of the workbench alongside a video of a pelican flying to compare and contrast for realistic "feel".
